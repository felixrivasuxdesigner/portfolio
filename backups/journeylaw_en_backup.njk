  <h2>Project Context</h2>
  <p>JourneyLaw is a comprehensive legal tech platform designed to streamline the workflow of small to mid-sized law firms. The platform integrates case management, client communication, document automation, and billing functionalities in a single, user-friendly interface.</p>
</div>

<div class="case-study-section">
  <h2>Challenge</h2>
  <p>Law firms were struggling with fragmented workflows, using multiple disconnected tools for different aspects of their practice. This led to inefficiencies, data duplication, and communication gaps. The challenge was to create a unified platform that would simplify legal workflows while maintaining the high standards of security and compliance required in the legal industry.</p>

  <h2>Research</h2>
  <div class="case-study-subsection">
    <h3>User Research Insights</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Lawyers spent up to 40% of their time on administrative tasks rather than legal work</li>
      <li>Most firms used 5-8 different software tools with minimal integration</li>
      <li>Client communication was frequently delayed due to inefficient processes</li>
      <li>Document management was a significant pain point with version control issues</li>
