<h2>Design Patterns Implemented</h2>
<h3>Compound Component Pattern</h3>
<p>Used to create complex components with intuitive APIs, such as the tab system:</p>
<pre><code class="language-tsx">function CaseDetailTabs({ caseId }: { caseId: string }) {
  return (
    &lt;Tabs defaultTab="documents"&gt;
      &lt;Tabs.List&gt;
        &lt;Tabs.Tab id="documents"&gt;Documents&lt;/Tabs.Tab&gt;
        &lt;Tabs.Tab id="timeline"&gt;History&lt;/Tabs.Tab&gt;
        &lt;Tabs.Tab id="payments"&gt;Payments&lt;/Tabs.Tab&gt;
      &lt;/Tabs.List&gt;
      
      &lt;Tabs.Panels&gt;
        &lt;Tabs.Panel id="documents"&gt;
          &lt;DocumentsList caseId={caseId} /&gt;
        &lt;/Tabs.Panel&gt;
        &lt;Tabs.Panel id="timeline"&gt;
          &lt;CaseTimeline caseId={caseId} /&gt;
        &lt;/Tabs.Panel&gt;
        &lt;Tabs.Panel id="payments"&gt;
          &lt;PaymentsList caseId={caseId} /&gt;
        &lt;/Tabs.Panel&gt;
      &lt;/Tabs.Panels&gt;
    &lt;/Tabs&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Container/Presentational Pattern</h3>
<p>Clear separation between business logic and presentation, allowing more efficient testing and maintenance:</p>
<pre><code class="language-tsx">// CaseListContainer.tsx - Logic
export function CaseListContainer() {
  const { data: cases, isLoading, error } = useCases();
  
  if (isLoading) return &lt;Spinner /&gt;;
  if (error) return &lt;ErrorMessage error={error} /&gt;;
  
  return &lt;CaseList cases={cases || []} /&gt;;
}

// CaseList.tsx - Presentation
export function CaseList({ cases }: CaseListProps) {
  return (
    &lt;div className="space-y-4"&gt;
      {cases.map((caseItem) =&gt; (
        &lt;CaseCard key={caseItem._id} {...caseItem} /&gt;
      ))}
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Custom Hooks Pattern</h3>
<p>Encapsulation of reusable logic and state management to facilitate:</p>
<pre><code class="language-typescript">// useCase hook - Abstraction for interacting with cases
export function useCase(id: string) {
  return useQuery(['case', id], () =&gt; caseService.getCase(id), {
    enabled: !!id,
    staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000 // 5 minutes
  });
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Interaction Design and User Experience</h2>
<h3>Interaction Design Philosophy</h3>
<p>Interaction design in JourneyLaw follows a clear principle: <strong>"Convert complexity into clarity"</strong>. This approach materializes in every aspect of the platform, from microcopy messages to navigation patterns.</p>
<h3>Microcopy System</h3>
<p>JourneyLaw's microcopy system is designed to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Humanize technical interactions</strong>: Transform complex legal concepts into accessible communications</li>
<li><strong>Proactively guide</strong>: Anticipate user needs</li>
<li><strong>Reduce cognitive load</strong>: Simplify complex decisions with clear messages</li>
<li><strong>Provide contextual feedback</strong>: Adapt tone according to emotional context</li>
</ul>
<h3>Error Message Transformation</h3>
<p>Instead of intimidating technical messages, JourneyLaw implements an empathetic approach:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Scenario</th>
<th>Traditional Message</th>
<th>JourneyLaw Approach</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Document rejected</td>
<td>"Error: Document rejected"</td>
<td>"This document needs some adjustments. We've added specific comments to help you complete it correctly."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Session expired</td>
<td>"401: Session expired"</td>
<td>"Your session has ended for security. We've saved all your changes. Sign in again to continue."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Plan limit reached</td>
<td>"Error: Limit exceeded"</td>
<td>"You've reached the limit of your current plan. Let's look at options so you can continue managing your cases without interruptions."</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
