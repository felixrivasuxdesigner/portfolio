## Design Patterns Implemented

### Compound Component Pattern

Used to create complex components with intuitive APIs, such as the tab system:

```tsx
function CaseDetailTabs({ caseId }: { caseId: string }) {
  return (
    <Tabs defaultTab="documents">
      <Tabs.List>
        <Tabs.Tab id="documents">Documents</Tabs.Tab>
        <Tabs.Tab id="timeline">History</Tabs.Tab>
        <Tabs.Tab id="payments">Payments</Tabs.Tab>
      </Tabs.List>
      
      <Tabs.Panels>
        <Tabs.Panel id="documents">
          <DocumentsList caseId={caseId} />
        </Tabs.Panel>
        <Tabs.Panel id="timeline">
          <CaseTimeline caseId={caseId} />
        </Tabs.Panel>
        <Tabs.Panel id="payments">
          <PaymentsList caseId={caseId} />
        </Tabs.Panel>
      </Tabs.Panels>
    </Tabs>
  );
}
```

### Container/Presentational Pattern

Clear separation between business logic and presentation, allowing more efficient testing and maintenance:

```tsx
// CaseListContainer.tsx - Logic
export function CaseListContainer() {
  const { data: cases, isLoading, error } = useCases();
  
  if (isLoading) return <Spinner />;
  if (error) return <ErrorMessage error={error} />;
  
  return <CaseList cases={cases || []} />;
}

// CaseList.tsx - Presentation
export function CaseList({ cases }: CaseListProps) {
  return (
    <div className="space-y-4">
      {cases.map((caseItem) => (
        <CaseCard key={caseItem._id} {...caseItem} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Custom Hooks Pattern

Encapsulation of reusable logic and state management to facilitate:

```typescript
// useCase hook - Abstraction for interacting with cases
export function useCase(id: string) {
  return useQuery(['case', id], () => caseService.getCase(id), {
    enabled: !!id,
    staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000 // 5 minutes
  });
}
```

## Interaction Design and User Experience

### Interaction Design Philosophy

Interaction design in JourneyLaw follows a clear principle: **"Convert complexity into clarity"**. This approach materializes in every aspect of the platform, from microcopy messages to navigation patterns.

### Microcopy System

JourneyLaw's microcopy system is designed to:

- **Humanize technical interactions**: Transform complex legal concepts into accessible communications
- **Proactively guide**: Anticipate user needs
- **Reduce cognitive load**: Simplify complex decisions with clear messages
- **Provide contextual feedback**: Adapt tone according to emotional context

### Error Message Transformation

Instead of intimidating technical messages, JourneyLaw implements an empathetic approach:

| Scenario | Traditional Message | JourneyLaw Approach |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Document rejected | "Error: Document rejected" | "This document needs some adjustments. We've added specific comments to help you complete it correctly." |
| Session expired | "401: Session expired" | "Your session has ended for security. We've saved all your changes. Sign in again to continue." |
| Plan limit reached | "Error: Limit exceeded" | "You've reached the limit of your current plan. Let's look at options so you can continue managing your cases without interruptions." |

## Accessibility Considerations

Accessibility is not an afterthought in JourneyLaw, but a fundamental principle from the conception of the project. The platform implements a comprehensive approach to ensure that legal professionals with diverse needs can effectively use all functionalities.
