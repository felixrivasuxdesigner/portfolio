  <h2>The Challenge</h2>
  <p>Radio Barrio Centenario, a historic pillar of the community, was facing generational and technological stagnation. Its traditional transmission model (FM) limited its geographic reach, and decision-making was centralized, pushing away new voices seeking to participate. The challenge was not just to digitize the signal, but to <strong>democratize ownership and management</strong> of the medium, transforming passive listeners into active members with a voice and vote.</p>

    <blockquote>"We needed the radio to stop being something people just listen to, and become something people <em>do</em> and <em>feel</em> as their own, no matter where they are."</blockquote>

<div class="case-study-section">
  <h2>My Approach</h2>
  
  <div class="case-study-subsection">
    <h3>Discovery & Inspiration</h3>
    <p>I started with a deep immersion in the community, conducting interviews with historic founders and workshops with young local creators. I discovered that the visual identity needed to evoke warmth and tradition, but the infrastructure had to be radically modern and transparent. Inspiration came from the fusion of the "analog" (human voice, history) and the "digital" (blockchain, global streaming).</p>
  </div>

  <div class="case-study-subsection">
    <h3>Experience Definition</h3>
    <p>I designed an information architecture centered on three fundamental pillars, guaranteeing that the technological complexity of a DAO was invisible to the end user:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Governance (DAO):</strong> A simplified voting system where community members use participation "tokens" to decide programming and elect directives.</li>
      <li><strong>Hybrid Streaming:</strong> Low-latency audio playback accessible from any mobile connection, with on-demand podcasting capabilities to preserve historical memory.</li>
      <li><strong>Living Community:</strong> Real-time interaction spaces (chat, reactions) integrated directly into the listening experience, eliminating the need for external social networks for immediate feedback.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="case-study-section">
  <h2>Design System</h2>
  
  <div class="case-study-subsection">
    <h3>Purposeful Color Palette</h3>
    <p>I selected a palette that balances nostalgia with innovation:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Brick Orange (#E65100):</strong> Represents the physical construction of the neighborhood and human warmth.</li>
      <li><strong>Night Blue (#1A237E):</strong> Evokes the depth of the radio ether and the institutional seriousness of governance.</li>
      <li><strong>Paper Cream (#F5F5F6):</strong> For comfortable reading backgrounds, alluding to historical scripts and pamphlets.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="case-study-subsection">
    <h3>Interface</h3>
    <p>The UI adopts a <strong>"Soft Neo-Brutalism"</strong> style. Large, readable buttons with high contrast to ensure accessibility on low-end devices, combined with subtle micro-interactions that give tactile feedback when voting or changing stations.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="case-study-subsection">
    <h3>Interactive Elements</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The Digital Dial:</strong> A modern circular control that allows "tuning" not only live radio, but navigating between podcasts and past events.</li>
      <li><strong>Voting Cards:</strong> Designed to be digestible, presenting DAO proposals with clear language and binary (Yes/No) or visual multiple-choice options.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="case-study-section">
  <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
  
  <div class="case-study-subsection">
    <h3>Streaming + Blockchain + Mobile</h3>
    <p>I led the experience design for a multi-platform ecosystem:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Streaming:</strong> Integration of Icecast protocols optimized for unstable mobile networks.</li>
      <li><strong>Invisible Web3:</strong> Authentication via simplified wallets (account abstraction) so users vote on the blockchain without managing complex seed phrases.</li>
      <li><strong>Native Apps:</strong> Development of Web App and Mobile App (iOS/Android) ready for deployment, ensuring visual and behavioral consistency.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="case-study-subsection">
    <h3>Optimization</h3>
    <p>Performance in audio loading and data consumption was prioritized, implementing aggressive <em>caching</em> strategies for static content and adaptive compression for the audio stream.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="case-study-section">
  <h2>Transformative Results</h2>
  
  <div class="case-study-subsection">
    <h3>For the Community</h3>
    <div class="case-study-quote">
      <blockquote>"Now I feel like my opinion counts. I voted for the new morning show from my phone while on my way to work. It's truly our radio."</blockquote>
      <cite>— Active Community Member</cite>

  </div>

  <div class="case-study-subsection">
    <h3>For Radio Barrio Centenario</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>300% increase</strong> in global audience thanks to digital streaming.</li>
      <li><strong>Historic participation</strong> in the first digital governance vote, surpassing the attendance of the last 5 physical assemblies combined.</li>
      <li><strong>Reduction in operating costs</strong> by digitalizing management and feedback processes.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>The Real Impact of My Work</h2>
  <p>This project demonstrated that decentralized technology (Web3/DAO) is not exclusive to finance, but a powerful tool for <strong>social innovation</strong>. We managed to weave stronger community ties through bits and waves, ensuring that Radio Barrio Centenario not only survives the digital age but defines what community media of the future should look like.</p>
