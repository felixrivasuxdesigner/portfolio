  <h2>Design Process</h2>
  
  <div class="case-study-subsection">
    <h3>1. Discovery & Research</h3>
    <p>I began with an intensive research phase:</p>
    
    <h4>User Interviews</h4>
    <p>Identified key needs such as centralized case management, document automation, and AI-based predictions.</p>
    
    <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
    <p>Identified opportunities for differentiation through: simplified interface, AI integration, and mobile-first approach.</p>
    
    <h4>Key Metrics Definition</h4>
    <p>Established clear KPIs:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>40% reduction in time to create new cases</li>
      <li>75% improvement in user satisfaction (NPS)</li>
      <li>65% increase in adoption of advanced features</li>

  </div>
  
  <div class="case-study-subsection">
    <h3>2. Information Architecture & User Flows</h3>
    <p>I completely redesigned the application structure:</p>
    
    <h4>New Legal Taxonomy</h4>
    <p>Developed an intuitive organization system that reflects how lawyers think about their cases.</p>
    
    <h4>Optimized User Flows</h4>
    <p>Reduced steps needed for common tasks:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Case creation: from 12 steps to 5</li>
      <li>Document management: from 8 steps to 3</li>
      <li>Report generation: from 15 steps to 4</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <div class="case-study-grid">
    <div class="case-study-grid-item">
      <h3>User Flow Mapping</h3>
      <p>We created comprehensive user flows for the core processes within the platform, ensuring that each user type could efficiently complete their tasks with minimal friction.</p>

  <h2>Technical Solutions</h2>
  
  <div class="case-study-subsection">
    <h3>Multi-Tenant Frontend Architecture</h3>
    <p>I faced the challenge of implementing a multi-tenant solution that maintained data security while offering a personalized experience.</p>
    
    <h4>I designed an interface architecture that:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Supports per-tenant customization (colors, logos, widgets)</li>
      <li>Implements granular access control based on roles and permissions</li>
      <li>Automatically filters data by <code>clientId</code> in each component</li>
      <li>Maintains optimal performance even with large volumes of data</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="code-example">
      <pre><code>
// Example of clientId filtering implementation in components
const CasesList = ({ filters }) => {
  const { clientId } = useAuthContext();
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Ensure clientId is always present in queries
    fetchCases({ ...filters, clientId });
  }, [filters, clientId]);
  
  // Rest of component...
}
      </code></pre>
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="case-study-subsection">
    <h3>Scalable Plan System</h3>
    <p>I designed the interface to show clear differences between plans, facilitating understanding of value and stimulating conversions:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Basic:</strong> Simplified interface with essential functionality</li>
      <li><strong>Pro:</strong> Customizable dashboard and advanced tools</li>
      <li><strong>Pro+:</strong> AI features for prediction and analysis</li>
      <li><strong>Enterprise:</strong> Fully customizable interfaces</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <div class="case-study-subsection">
    <h3>AI Integration with UX</h3>
    <p>I integrated AI capabilities while keeping the user in control:</p>
    
    <h4>Legal AI Assistant</h4>
    <p>A contextual chatbot that understands legal jargon and suggests precedents.</p>
    
    <h4>Predictive Analysis</h4>
    <p>Interactive visualizations of success probabilities and estimated duration.</p>
    
    <h4>Intelligent Document Generation</h4>
    <p>Interfaces that combine smart templates with the user's ability to customize.</p>

  <h2>Technical Challenges & Solutions</h2>
  
  <div class="case-study-subsection">
    <h3>Challenge 1: Multi-tenancy with data security</h3>
    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> We needed a solution that kept each client's data completely isolated while sharing the same infrastructure.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> I implemented a `clientId`-based architecture that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Filters all data at the interface level to show only what's relevant to the current tenant</li>
      <li>Uses JWT tokens with encrypted `clientId` to secure each request</li>
      <li>Implements security checks in each component that displays sensitive data</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <div class="case-study-subsection">
    <h3>Challenge 2: Performance with large volumes of legal data</h3>
    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Large firms handle thousands of documents and cases, causing UI performance issues.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> I designed a progressive loading system with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>List virtualization to handle thousands of items with native performance</li>
      <li>Lazy loading of heavy assets like PDFs and scanned documents</li>
      <li>Intelligent cache implementation for frequently accessed documents</li>
      <li>Optimized pagination and filtering system for large databases</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <div class="case-study-subsection">
    <h3>Challenge 3: Accessible design for a diverse audience</h3>
    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Users had different levels of technological experience and some had accessibility issues.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Implemented high contrast controls and adjustable text size</li>
      <li>Created fully keyboard-navigable interfaces</li>
      <li>Designed multiple viewing modes: simplified, standard, and advanced</li>
      <li>Ensured WCAG 2.1 AA compatibility throughout the platform</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="case-study-section">
  <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
  <p>This project reinforced several key principles:</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Domain complexity doesn't justify complex UX</strong><br>
    Despite the complex nature of legal work, we achieved simple and intuitive interfaces.</li>
    
    <li><strong>The value of micro-moments</strong><br>
    Refining small interactions had a disproportionate impact on satisfaction.</li>
    
    <li><strong>AI as an enhancer, not a replacement</strong><br>
    The most successful AI integration was one that complemented human work without trying to replace it.</li>
    
    <li><strong>The importance of contextual microcopy</strong><br>
    We developed a system of contextual messages that reduced frustration and guided the user at critical moments.</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<div class="case-study-section">
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>JourneyLaw demonstrates my ability to transform a complex domain into an intuitive and valuable digital experience. The project represents a perfect balance between user-centered design, robust technical implementation, and effective business strategy.</p>
  
  <p>As lead UX/UI Designer and frontend developer on this project, I was able to apply my experience to create a product that not only looks and functions exceptionally well but generates real and measurable impact on the daily work of legal professionals.</p>
  
  <p>JourneyLaw is now a growing platform that continues to evolve based on the solid design and implementation foundations we established, demonstrating that with the right approach, even the most traditional industries can benefit from digital transformation.</p>
