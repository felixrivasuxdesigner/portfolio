  <h2>The Challenge</h2>
  <p>"Analysis Paralysis" is the silent enemy of every product team. UX Researchers were spending more time transcribing and tagging hours of interviews than connecting dots and generating strategic insights. Qualitative richness was lost in endless spreadsheets or locked away in hour-long videos no one ever watched again. The challenge was to create a tool that didn't just transcribe, but "thought" like a senior researcher, automating synthesis without losing human empathy.</p>

    <blockquote>"We have terabytes of user feedback, but it takes us a week to process 5 interviews. By the time we have the report, the sprint is over."</blockquote>

<div class="case-study-section">
  <h2>My Approach</h2>
  
  <div class="case-study-subsection">
    <h3>Discovery & Inspiration</h3>
    <p>I shadowed research teams in startups and corporations. I identified that the real pain wasn't data capture, but <strong>synthesis and traceability</strong>. Visual inspiration came from high-frequency financial <em>dashboards</em>: information density, absolute clarity, and smart alerts, but adapted to the language of human behavior.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="case-study-subsection">
    <h3>Experience Definition</h3>
    <p>I designed a workflow that acts as a "copilot" for the researcher, structured in three levels of depth:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Intelligent Processing:</strong> Video/audio ingestion with real-time speaker diarization.</li>
      <li><strong>Augmented Synthesis:</strong> Automatic generation of "Golden Quotes", sentiment detection, and pain point prioritization classified by severity (Critical/High/Medium).</li>
      <li><strong>Structured Validation:</strong> Dynamic matrices where hypotheses are automatically cross-referenced with collected evidence, allowing assumptions to be validated or refuted in seconds.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="case-study-section">
  <h2>Design System</h2>
  
  <div class="case-study-subsection">
    <h3>Purposeful Color Palette</h3>
    <p>Trust and precision guided the color choices:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cobalt Blue (#0047AB):</strong> Authority, intelligence, and deep technology.</li>
      <li><strong>Electric Cyan (#00E5FF):</strong> Highlights AI-generated insights, differentiating them from raw data.</li>
      <li><strong>Slate Gray (#263238):</strong> Dark interface backgrounds to reduce visual fatigue during long analysis sessions.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="case-study-subsection">
    <h3>Interface</h3>
    <p>The UI follows a <strong>"Data-First"</strong> style. We prioritized long text readability and pattern visualization. Subtle "Glassmorphism" helps prioritize information layers without saturating the screen.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="case-study-subsection">
    <h3>Interactive Elements</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Augmented Timeline:</strong> A video player where interest markers (positive, negative, quotes) appear visually over the audio <em>timeline</em>.</li>
      <li><strong>Side Insights Panel:</strong> A contextual assistant that suggests tags and patterns while the researcher plays the interview.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="case-study-section">
  <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
  
  <div class="case-study-subsection">
    <h3>AI + Streaming + Real-time</h3>
    <p>I led the definition of a robust architecture to handle sensitive data and heavy processing:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Secure Streaming:</strong> Encrypted protocols for transmission and storage of confidential user material.</li>
      <li><strong>Advanced NLP:</strong> Integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned specifically for UX and Product terminology.</li>
      <li><strong>Real-time Feedback:</strong> Websockets to allow other team members to add notes or marks during a live interview.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="case-study-subsection">
    <h3>Optimization</h3>
    <p>Lazy loading was implemented for massive transcripts and virtualized rendering for lists of thousands of <em>data points</em>, ensuring fluidity even in massive projects.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="case-study-section">
  <h2>Transformative Results</h2>
  
  <div class="case-study-subsection">
    <h3>For Research Teams</h3>
    <div class="case-study-quote">
      <blockquote>"IntelliResearch reduced our synthesis time from 4 days to 4 hours. Now we spend that time devising solutions, not transcribing."</blockquote>
      <cite>— Product Manager</cite>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="case-study-subsection">
    <h3>For Organizations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>80% reduction</strong> in post-interview processing time.</li>
      <li><strong>40% increase</strong> in reuse of old insights thanks to a centralized semantic search engine.</li>
      <li><strong>Standardization</strong> of research reports, improving communication with stakeholders.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="case-study-section">
  <h2>The Real Impact of My Work</h2>
  <p>IntelliResearch transformed the researcher's role, freeing them from administrative tasks to empower their strategic capacity. We demonstrated that AI does not replace human intuition, but <strong>amplifies</strong> it, allowing us to listen to more users with greater depth and turn that empathy into better digital products.</p>
